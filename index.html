      <h2>About Me — Vivek Sharma</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Senior Data Engineer with close to 10 years of experience building, optimizing, and scaling robust data platforms. I specialize in real-time data pipelines, data lake architecture, event-driven ingestion systems, and big data automation, with a proven track record of transforming business-critical infrastructure across healthcare, fintech, AdTech, and SaaS verticals.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I’ve bridged the gap between hands-on engineering and strategic leadership. From designing ETL frameworks and compliance-ready dataflows to mentoring team members and aligning with cross-functional stakeholders, I’ve consistently driven outcomes that scale with business growth and technical complexity.

      <h2>Philosophy & Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in building scalable systems and scalable people. Every platform I’ve architected is built to adapt, evolve, and empower. I treat platform resilience, team onboarding, and cross-functional alignment as first-class citizens of engineering success.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I’ve operated as a technical lead long before earning the title — taking ownership of platform vision, engaging in sprint planning, writing design docs, and mentoring junior engineers on best practices and patterns.

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>
        I’m on a path toward an official <strong>Engineering Manager</strong> or <strong>Data Architect</strong> role — one where I can drive systemic change while enabling my team to do their best work. I want to keep solving hard data problems, building tools that matter, and helping companies turn their data into a durable strategic advantage.
