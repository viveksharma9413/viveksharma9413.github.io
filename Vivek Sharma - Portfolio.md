| **Snowflake Compliance Data Marts** | Architect & Lead | Designed **dbt** models on **Snowflake** serving provider-compliance and license-freshness marts. Used **incremental models** for sanctions history, **snapshots** for SCD Type 2 license states, and **dbt tests** (not_null, unique, relationships, freshness) to guarantee NCQA-grade data quality. Orchestrated runs via **Airflow** with Airbyte-loaded sources. |
| **CB1.5 Pipeline – Sanctions & License Ingestion** | Lead Engineer & Architect | Designed and led CertifyOS's largest ingestion system, migrating 500+ manually processed license file types into a unified, job-config-driven ELT pipeline. Orchestrated end-to-end with **Apache Airflow (Cloud Composer)**, ingested sources via **Airbyte**, and applied **dbt models** in BigQuery. Achieved full automation of monthly state license refreshes, previously handled via separate scripts per file. |
| **SCD Type 2 Utility** | Designer & Developer | Built reusable **dbt snapshot and incremental models** on **Snowflake** and BigQuery for Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2) using hash-based change tracking. Applied across sanctions datasets lacking primary keys, ensuring accurate historical tracking and auditability with isCurrent, startDate, and endDate logic. |
| **NPPES to DAL Transformation** | Architect & Engineer | Developed **dbt staging and mart models** in BigQuery to convert flat nppes_raw tables into nested DAL-ready practitioner payloads for API ingestion. Coordinated with Platform team to validate schemas, manage chunked ingestion, and support 300+ column mappings. |
| **Matching Engine for Sanctions Attribution** | Co-designer | Co-developed a fuzzy matching engine to attribute provider sanctions to practitioners using name, address, and license matching. Critical for linking records lacking NPIs, improving attribution rate from 75% to 97%. |
| **Scraper Automation Layer DAG** | Builder & Coordinator | Created an **Airflow DAG** to orchestrate **Airbyte** syncs of scraper outputs into validation pipelines. Integrated with license enrichment and matching layers to support NCQA license freshness compliance. Worked closely with the Scraper team to finalize source contracts and ensure reliable ingestion. |
| **NCQA License Refresh Pipeline** | Designer | Enabled compliance by designing an **Airflow-orchestrated** system that ensures all licenses are refreshed within 30 days, powered by the scraper automation layer. Tracked freshness across license types and ensured seamless updates into internal compliance systems. |
| **GitHub Actions Release Pipelines** | DevOps Contributor | Implemented CI/CD workflows for Python package deployment to Google Artifact Registry with retry logic, version bumping, and concurrency controls. Segregated staging (release/stage-*) and production (release/main) workflows with semantic versioning and selective rebuilds. |
| **CertifyOS API Mapping & Integration** | Technical Lead | Mapped multiple flat datasets (NPPES, sanctions, licenses) to deeply nested API schemas. Ensured complete schema validation, null handling, type coercion, and custom field logic for payload ingestion into DAL endpoints. |
| **State Sanctions Dataflow Design (CB1.5)** | Dataflow Architect | Designed the DataFlow logic for ingesting state sanctions files using a config-driven approach with schema and transformation logic maintained in BQ config tables. Enabled scalable file parsing and publishing of standardized records into Pub/Sub for downstream CB2.0 systems. |
